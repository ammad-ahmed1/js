      particular place in our code.<br />

      - And is the variable is in outer function or inner function <br />
      - Inner function's variables can't be accessed from outer functions

    <h3>Lexical Scope</h3>
    <p>
      Lexical scope is a way to describe how JavaScript determines which
      variables are accessible at different parts of your code. Simply put,
      lexical scope refers to where a variable or function is available (or "in
      scope") based on where itâ€™s written in the code.
